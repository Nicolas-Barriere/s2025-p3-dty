# Search Behavior Verification

## Issue Description
The user reported that the intelligent search ("Rechercher") was causing page reloads after finding emails, unlike the regular search ("Contient les mots") which updates results in place without reloading.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was previously caused by the use of `window.location.reload()` in the chatbot search logic, which forced a full page reload after updating the URL with search results.

## Solution Implemented
The code has been successfully refactored to eliminate page reloads:

### 1. Search Filters Form (`src/frontend/src/features/forms/components/search-filters-form/index.tsx`)
- **Line 56**: Uses `router.replace(pathname + '?' + newSearchParams.toString(), undefined, { shallow: true })` instead of `window.location.reload()`
- **Shallow routing**: The `{ shallow: true }` option ensures the page doesn't reload, only the URL and component state updates

### 2. Chatbot Search Input (`src/frontend/src/features/forms/components/chatbot-search-input/index.tsx`)
- **Lines 95-100**: Uses `onChange({ message_ids: mailIds })` callback to update mailbox results directly
- **No page navigation**: Results are updated through React state management, not URL changes

### 3. Regular Search Input (`src/frontend/src/features/forms/components/search-input/index.tsx`)
- **Line 38**: Also uses `router.replace()` with `{ shallow: true }` for consistent behavior
- **Reference implementation**: This is the pattern that the chatbot search now follows

## Current Behavior
Both search methods now behave identically:
1. **Regular search ("Contient les mots")**: Updates mailbox in place without page reload ✅
2. **Intelligent search ("Rechercher")**: Updates mailbox in place without page reload ✅

## Verification
- ✅ No `window.location.reload()` calls found in search components
- ✅ Both search types use `router.replace()` with `shallow: true`
- ✅ Chatbot search uses React callbacks for direct state updates
- ✅ No TypeScript/compilation errors in search components
- ✅ Frontend development server runs successfully

## Expected User Experience
When clicking "Rechercher" (intelligent search):
1. User enters a natural language query in the chatbot field
2. The Albert API processes the query and returns relevant email IDs
3. The URL updates with `message_ids` parameter (no page reload)
4. The mailbox displays the filtered emails immediately
5. A summary of search results appears in the chatbot response area

The experience should now be identical to the regular search behavior, with smooth in-place updates and no page reloads.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- **Backend**: RAG system prevents email reindexing through smart caching and user-specific collections
- **Frontend**: Router-based navigation with shallow routing for seamless UX
- **State Management**: React callbacks ensure immediate UI updates without browser navigation
