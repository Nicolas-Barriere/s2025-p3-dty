# Score Threshold Filtering Enhancement

## Feature Overview
Added **score threshold filtering** to intelligent search to only display emails with high relevance scores, ensuring users see only the most pertinent results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Added
**File**: `src/backend/chatbot/config.py`
```python
min_relevance_score: float = 0.3  # Minimum score threshold for displaying results
```

### 2. Filtering Logic Added
**File**: `src/backend/chatbot/email_service.py`

Enhanced the RAG search processing to:
- **Check score threshold**: Filter out emails with scores below `min_relevance_score`
- **Log filtering**: Debug logs show which emails are filtered out
- **Enhanced metadata**: Include score in AI reason and add filtering statistics

```python
# Apply score threshold filtering - only include results above minimum relevance
if relevance_score < rag_system.config.min_relevance_score:
    self.logger.debug(f"Filtered out email {matched_email_id} with low score {relevance_score:.3f} (threshold: {rag_system.config.min_relevance_score})")
    continue
```

## How It Works

### Before Enhancement
```
RAG Query: "urgent meeting documents"
Albert API returns 10 results with scores:
1. Email A: 0.85 (very relevant) ✅
2. Email B: 0.72 (relevant) ✅  
3. Email C: 0.51 (somewhat relevant) ✅
4. Email D: 0.28 (weak match) ✅ 
5. Email E: 0.15 (barely relevant) ✅
6. Email F: 0.09 (poor match) ✅
... all 10 emails shown
```

### After Enhancement
```
RAG Query: "urgent meeting documents"
Albert API returns 10 results with scores:
1. Email A: 0.85 (very relevant) ✅ Shown
2. Email B: 0.72 (relevant) ✅ Shown
3. Email C: 0.51 (somewhat relevant) ✅ Shown
4. Email D: 0.28 (weak match) ❌ Filtered out (< 0.3)
5. Email E: 0.15 (barely relevant) ❌ Filtered out (< 0.3)
6. Email F: 0.09 (poor match) ❌ Filtered out (< 0.3)
... only 3 high-quality emails shown
```

## Configuration Options

### Score Threshold Values
- **0.1**: Very permissive (almost all results shown)
- **0.3**: Balanced (default) - filters out weak matches
- **0.5**: Strict - only moderately to highly relevant results
- **0.7**: Very strict - only very relevant results

### Customization
The threshold can be adjusted in `config.py`:
```python
min_relevance_score: float = 0.5  # For stricter filtering
```

## Benefits

### 1. Higher Quality Results
- **Eliminates noise**: Weak matches don't clutter the results
- **Focus on relevance**: Users see only truly relevant emails
- **Better user experience**: Less scrolling through irrelevant results

### 2. Dynamic Result Count
- **Adaptive filtering**: Result count varies based on query quality
- **Quality over quantity**: May show 2-3 excellent matches vs 10 mediocre ones
- **Transparent feedback**: Logs show how many emails were filtered

### 3. Improved Search Satisfaction
- **Higher precision**: Reduced false positives in search results
- **Trust in AI**: Users trust the system more when results are consistently relevant
- **Faster task completion**: Users find what they need more quickly

## Response Metadata Enhanced

The API now returns additional information:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "results": [...], // Only high-scoring results
    "total_searched": 500,
    "total_matched": 10,
    "results_after_filtering": 3,
    "score_threshold": 0.3,
    "processing_time": 2.1
}
```

## Logging Enhanced

Debug logs now include filtering information:
```
INFO: Step 6 completed: Matched and formatted 3 email results (after score filtering with threshold 0.3)
DEBUG: Filtered out email abc123 with low score 0.285 (threshold: 0.3)
DEBUG: Added result for email def456 with score 0.742
```

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **No breaking changes**: API response format unchanged
- ✅ **Optional filtering**: Can be disabled by setting threshold to 0.0
- ✅ **Default threshold**: Conservative 0.3 maintains good results while filtering noise
- ✅ **Configurable**: Easy to adjust based on user feedback

This enhancement ensures that intelligent search delivers **quality over quantity** - users see fewer but more relevant results! 🎯
