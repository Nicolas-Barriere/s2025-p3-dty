# Email Retrieval Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the `src/backend/chatbot/email_retrieval.py` file by incorporating existing patterns and functions from the API viewsets, especially from `message.py` and `thread_access.py`, to improve security, performance, and functionality.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Permission Checking**
- **Before**: Basic access checks without proper permission validation
- **After**: Integrated the same permission patterns used in `MessageViewSet` and `ThreadViewSet`
- **Changes**:
  - Added user ID parameters to all functions for proper permission checking
  - Used `Exists()` and `OuterRef()` patterns from the viewsets
  - Implemented mailbox access validation using the same patterns as `MailboxViewSet.get_queryset()`

### 2. **Improved Database Queries**
- **Before**: Simple queries without optimization
- **After**: Applied the same optimization patterns from the viewsets
- **Changes**:
  - Added proper `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` calls
  - Used the same queryset patterns as `MessageViewSet.get_queryset()`
  - Leveraged `mailbox.threads_viewer` property like `ThreadViewSet`

### 3. **Elasticsearch Integration**
- **Before**: Only database-based search
- **After**: Integrated with existing `search_threads` functionality
- **Changes**:
  - Added `use_elasticsearch` parameter to search functions
  - Implemented fallback to database search when Elasticsearch fails
  - Used the same search patterns as `ThreadViewSet.search()`

### 4. **Enhanced Function Signatures**

#### `get_user_accessible_mailboxes(user_id: str)`
- Uses the same pattern as `MailboxViewSet.get_queryset()`
- Added proper ordering and related field selection

#### `get_mailbox_threads(mailbox_id: str, user_id: str, limit: int = 50, filters: Optional[Dict] = None)`
- Added user permission checking
- Integrated filters similar to `ThreadViewSet` (has_unread, has_starred, etc.)
- Uses `mailbox.threads_viewer` property

#### `get_thread_messages(thread_id: str, user_id: str, include_drafts: bool = False)`
- Added proper permission checking using `ThreadAccess` patterns
- Uses the same queryset optimization as `MessageViewSet`

#### `get_message_by_id(message_id: str, user_id: str)`
- Enhanced with permission checking using `Exists()` pattern
- Same optimization as `MessageViewSet.get_queryset()`

#### `search_messages(user_id: str, query: str = "", mailbox_id: Optional[str] = None, limit: int = 20, include_archived: bool = False, use_elasticsearch: bool = True)`
- Integrated Elasticsearch search with database fallback
- Uses the same mailbox access patterns
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 5. **New Functions Added**

#### `get_thread_statistics(user_id: str, mailbox_id: Optional[str] = None)`
- Similar to the ThreadViewSet stats functionality
- Provides thread statistics (total, unread, starred, etc.)

#### `search_threads_for_chatbot(user_id: str, query: str = "", mailbox_id: Optional[str] = None, limit: int = 10, filters: Optional[Dict] = None)`
- Wrapper around the existing `search_threads` functionality
- Provides thread-level search for the chatbot
- Includes participant information

### 6. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Before**: Basic try-catch blocks
- **After**: Comprehensive error handling following API patterns
- **Changes**:
  - Added specific error messages for permission denied scenarios
  - Better logging with context information
  - Graceful fallbacks when services are unavailable

### 7. **Security Improvements**
- All functions now require user authentication
- Permission checks are performed at the database level
- Uses the same security patterns as the existing API endpoints
- Prevents unauthorized access to emails and threads

## Usage Examples

### Enhanced Search with Elasticsearch
```python
# Search messages with Elasticsearch fallback
results = search_messages(
    user_id="user-uuid",
    query="important meeting",
    mailbox_id="mailbox-uuid",
    use_elasticsearch=True
)
```

### Get Threads with Filters
```python
# Get unread threads for a specific mailbox
threads = get_mailbox_threads(
    mailbox_id="mailbox-uuid",
    user_id="user-uuid",
    filters={"has_unread": True, "has_starred": False}
)
```

### Enhanced Content Retrieval
```python
# Get email content with permission checking
content = retrieve_email_content_by_query(
    user_id="user-uuid",
    query="project deadline",
    use_elasticsearch=True
)
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing API Viewsets
- `MessageViewSet`: Permission checking, queryset optimization
- `ThreadViewSet`: Thread filtering, search integration
- `MailboxViewSet`: Mailbox access patterns
- `ThreadAccessViewSet`: Permission validation

### With Search Infrastructure
- `core.search.search_threads`: Elasticsearch integration
- Automatic fallback to database search
- Same query parsing and filtering logic

### With Permission System
- `core.api.permissions.IsAllowedToAccess`: Same permission patterns
- Thread access validation through `ThreadAccess` model
- Mailbox access validation through `MailboxAccess` model

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced database queries through proper use of `select_related` and `prefetch_related`
- Leveraged existing optimized querysets from viewsets
- Added Elasticsearch for faster search operations
- Proper indexing usage following existing patterns

## Security Enhancements
- All operations now require user authentication
- Permission checks at database level prevent unauthorized access
- Uses the same security model as the API endpoints
- Prevents information leakage through proper access controls

## Backward Compatibility
- Function signatures have been updated to include user_id parameters
- Old function calls will need to be updated to include user authentication
- Enhanced functions provide more detailed error information
- Return formats remain largely compatible with additional metadata

This enhancement brings the chatbot email retrieval functions in line with the existing API security and performance standards while adding powerful search capabilities through Elasticsearch integration.
